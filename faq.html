      <h2>Is Cold AI fully automated?</h2>
      <p>No. We enforce a human-in-the-loop workflow. Cold AI researches and drafts messages, but a human must approve them before they are sent. You always retain full control and can edit/refine before sending.</p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Does it work with email and LinkedIn?</h2>
      <p>Yes. The engine unifies your outreach. Cold AI can draft a LinkedIn connection request and a follow-up email in the same sequence, ensuring context is carried across channels.</p>

      <h2>Is this GDPR compliant?</h2>

      <h2>Can I integrate this into my own product?</h2>
