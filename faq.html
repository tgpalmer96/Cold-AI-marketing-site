      <div class="card">
        <h3>Is Cold AI fully automated?</h3>
        <p>No. We enforce a human-in-the-loop workflow. Cold AI researches and drafts messages, but a human must approve them before they are sent. You always retain full control and can edit/refine before sending.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Does it work with email and LinkedIn?</h3>
        <p>Yes. The engine unifies your outreach. Cold AI can draft a LinkedIn connection request and a follow-up email in the same sequence, ensuring context is carried across channels.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Is this GDPR compliant?</h3>
        <p>Yes. We process public business data and rely on Legitimate Interest for B2B prospecting. We do not store personal data longer than necessary for the outreach campaign.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Can I integrate this into my own product?</h3>
        <p>Yes. We are API-first. You can use our endpoints to trigger research or drafting from within your own CRM or agentic workflow.</p>
