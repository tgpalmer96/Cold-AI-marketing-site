      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Is Cold AI fully automated?</h3>
        <p>No. We enforce a human-in-the-loop workflow. Cold AI researches and drafts messages, but a human must approve them before they are sent. You always retain full control and can edit/refine before sending.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Does it work with email and LinkedIn?</h3>
        <p>Yes. The engine unifies your outreach. Cold AI can draft a LinkedIn connection request and a follow-up email in the same sequence, ensuring context is carried across channels.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Is this GDPR compliant?</h3>
        <p>Yes. We process public business data and rely on Legitimate Interest for B2B prospecting. We do not store personal data longer than necessary for the outreach campaign.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Can I integrate this into my own product?</h3>
        <p>Yes. We are API-first. You can use our endpoints to trigger research or drafting from within your own CRM or agentic workflow.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>What is Warm AI?</h3>
        <p>Warm AI is our sister agent that identifies companies visiting your website and pushes that data into Cold AI, allowing you to trigger outbound sequences based on inbound intent. Learn more at warmai.uk</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>What problem does Cold AI solve?</h3>

      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>How does Cold AI find relevant information about my prospects?</h3>
        <p>Cold AI deploys agents that scan and analyze a prospect’s LinkedIn profile and recent activity to understand who they are, what they care about, and what problems they are likely facing right now.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>How does Cold AI tailor each message to the prospect?</h3>
        <p>Cold AI generates a unique, relevant message for every single prospect. It does not rely on templates or generic messaging. Each message is grounded in research about the individual or company being contacted.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>What does “agentic AI” mean in the context of Cold AI?</h3>
        <p>Agentic AI refers to workflows where multiple AI agents independently execute research and analysis tasks. In Cold AI, these agents identify what is most relevant about a prospect at the moment the message is written, rather than relying on static inputs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Are messages generated by Cold AI conversational or robotic?</h3>
        <p>Messages are designed to be human, clear, and conversational. Cold AI has been engineered by sales psychologists to avoid robotic language and respect the recipient’s inbox.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Can I review and edit AI-generated messages before they are sent?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Cold AI uses a strict human-in-the-loop workflow. The AI drafts messages, but nothing is sent without human approval. You always retain full control.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Does Cold AI support multi-channel outreach?</h3>

      <div class="card">
